# Time-series-acoustic-classification-with-Tensorflow

This classification is different from spectrogram based classification because we have timestamps in this dataset and need to deal with 1 dimensional data unlike spectrogram (2 dimensional data) one.

**Approach**
Data is labeled at each timestamp in three class i.e Muzzle, Shockwave, None

Tensorflow framework is used to frame level classification
